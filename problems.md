## Problems

### Knapsack problem

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection (knapsack) so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem))

### Set-covering problem

Given a set of elements, e.g. `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (called the universe) and a collection of sets, e.g. `[[1, 2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4], [4, 5]]` whose union equals the universe, find the smallest sub-collection of sets whose union equals the universe.
